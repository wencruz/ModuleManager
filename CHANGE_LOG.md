# Module Manager :: Change Log

* 2018-0208: 3.0.2 (sarbian) for KSP 1.3
	+ No changelog provided
* 2017-1206: 3.0.1 (sarbian) for KSP 1.3
	+ Add a -mm-dump cmd line option and redo the export
	+ Now uses the same directory sub tree as GameData
	+ Fix NEEDS checking for inner nodes/values
	+ Didn't work if you had both top level NEEDS and NEEDS on a subnode/value
	+ since it was checking NEEDS on the wrong node in that case
* 2017-1202: 3.0.0 (sarbian) for KSP 1.3
	+ Begin splitting files up (#76)
		- rename file
		- most of it is MMPatchLoader so that's what it'll be
			- Remove corrupt #region
		- It starts in one class and ends in another, I can't tell where it's
	+ really supposed to go
			- Move addon to its own file
			- Put cats in a box
			- Can has namespace
			- Promote business cat to manager
			- Unnecessary now
			- Old stuff
	+ Change debug C# version to default
	+ VS, why u do dis?
	+ Add ImmutableStack class
	+ Add PatchContext struct
	+ Use ImmutableStack and PatchContext in MM
	+ Remove unused code
	+ Apparently had to do with texture replacer corruption, but not called
	+ anywhere
	+ Implement IEnumerable<T>
	+ Add Depth property
	+ Use immutability in CheckNeeds
	+ Forgot a using directive
	+ Ged rid of Win64 specific code
	+ Doesn't matter anymore
	+ Needs to be included in the project too
	+ Add logging interface
	+ Extract progress into its own object
	+ Use logger and progress
	+ Make some things static that no longer depend on the patch loader's
	+ state
	+ Remove blocking option
	+ It's no longer used
	+ Use inline variable declaration
	+ Make log messages consistent
	+ Make deletes and copies count toward patch count
	+ Make names more accurate
	+ These are called before the patch is applied
	+ Simplify null check
	+ move main project to its own directory
	+ Allows more to be added
	+ Better output dir for debug
	+ Do not copy local
	+ Add test project
	+ Add MM, Assembly-CSharp, UnityEngine refs
	+ Add console runner
	+ Will be needed eventually
	+ Yo dawg, I heard you like tests
	+ Add TestConfigNode class
	+ Makes testing with ConfigNodes by simplifying creating them
	+ Reference TestUtils
	+ Don't reference a specific version of System
	+ Add test for ImmutableStack
	+ Add test for GetPath
	+ Add NSubstitute
	+ Add tests for ModLogger
	+ Fix an error
	+ Add UrlBuilder
	+ Hackily creates UrlDir, UrlFile, UrlConfig for testing purposes
	+ Progress shouldn't depend on deleted subnodes
	+ The number of needs unsatisfied nodes it should be counting is the
	+ number of root nodes that have been removed, not subnodes as well
	+ These should use actual URLs
	+ Since all the calls were just using .url anyway
	+ These too
	+ Minor logging tweak
	+ Add tests for PatchProgress
	+ Replace DeepCopy with ConfigNode.CreateCopy
	+ It does 100% the same thing (and is recursive)
	+ Inline out variable declarations
	+ Yay C#7
	+ Obey naming conventions
	+ Pull Command and ParseCommand out of MMPatchLoader
	+ Would be nice if enums allowed static methods
	+ Extract ShallowCopy
		- this" is the node you're copying to so that the extension method is
	+ only modifying "its" node
	+ Don't create duplicates in UrlBuilder
	+ Add ArrayEnumerator
	+ Enumerates arrays in a garbage-free way
	+ PatchList
	+ list of patches, 'nuff said
	+ Add PatchExtractor
	+ Extracts patches from the game database and sorts them
	+ Add SafeUrl extension method for UrlConfig
	+ Makes sure logging doesn't mess up, and fixes the weird quirk where a
	+ node with a name value ends up displaying that instead of its actual
	+ name
	+ Use SafeUrl in logging
	+ Remove unused
	+ Doesn't really have any benefit
	+ Log when BEFORE or AFTER patch deleted
	+ This is pretty much equivalent to unsatisfied NEEDS, so it should be
	+ noted as such.  Also log on an unsatisfied FOR, although this shouldn't
	+ happen (make it a warning)
	+ Fix case issues
	+ Mods may not be lowercase to begin with, need to handle this
	+ Extract IsBracketBalanced
	+ Remove bracket unbalanced nodes when sorting
	+ Unused method
	+ Bring back DeepCopy
	+ Apparently KSP's default implementation fails on badly formed nodes
	+ Fix bad region
	+ Make sure badly formed mod passes are an error
	+ That's a bug
	+ Add some explanatory comments
	+ Unnecessary using directives
	+ Use sorted patches when applying
	+ Improves performance somewhat
	+ Verified that sorting patches takes almost no time even for a fairly
	+ large number of patches
	+ Remove now-unnecessary try-catch
	+ There's already one around it and we no longer care about removing
	+ patches from the database at this stage
	+ Replace big if with guard clause
	+ Reduces indentation.  Insert nodes shouldn't exist here anyway
	+ Simplify this
	+ It no longer has to look in actual passes here, so we can just use the
	+ name we want it to display.
	+ It does change the way it displays in the loading screen but that seems
	+ fine.
	+ Invalid command = error on the patch extractor
	+ This seems like the right place to check it
	+ Extract RemoveWS
	+ Fix logging
	+ Extract PrettyPrint
	+ Get rid of unnecesary using directives
	+ Don't run PrePatchInit if cache is being used
	+ Mod list is not necessary
	+ Eliminate mods instance variable
	+ Use method param rather than instance var
	+ Makes things easier to disentagle
	+ Eliminate Update
	+ Status will be updated when necessary anyway
	+ Eliminate redundant logging
	+ MMPatchLoader logs this info itself
	+ Keep track of progress fraction independently
	+ Make StatusUpdate less general
	+ If cache is used, status only needs to be set once, no need to check it
	+ every time
	+ Move this
	+ What I get for trying to make a bunch of changes and then split them
	+ into small commits
	+ Eliminate Progress instance variable
	+ Make it local, inject where needed
	+ Make more methods static
	+ All their instance variable dependencies have been eliminated
	+ This is no longer necessary
	+ And will probably result in an error anyway
	+ Move exception handling outside of PrettyConfig
	+ Callers really shouldn't be trying to print the result if it resulted in
	+ an exception anyway
	+ Tweak test
	+ This isn't the case it was trying to test
	+ Allow adding a ConfigNode.Value in initializer
	+ Not useful yet but maybe at some point
	+ Extract PrettyConfig (for UrlConfig)
	+ Add one more test
	+ Make CheckNeeds static
	+ Can now be extracted
	+ This can already be static
	+ Remove unnecessary Using
	+ Improve url and node printing
			- Handle null name explicitly
			- Include url when printing a UrlConfig
	+ Extract CheckNeeds
	+ Equality vs sameness mostly not tested for now, need to determine
	+ desired behavior
	+ Ensure that final string printed to the screen is the actual status
	+ Fix up mod list logging
			- Use a string builder
			- Print assemblies in a nicer format (table)
	+ Use Path.Combine
	+ It's more concise then concatenating with the separator char
	+ Unnecessary now
	+ Improve assembly list
			- Get rid of unused code
			- Include KSPAssembly version
	+ Accidentally removed
	+ Move tracking number of patches
	+ from mod list to sorting patches
	+ Put progress counts in their own object
	+ Allows the same counts to be used with a different logger.  Also remove
	+ unused setter for NeedsUnsatisfiedRootCount
	+ Move exception handling out of FIleSHA
	+ Callers should be aware of exceptions anyway
	+ Extract FileSHA
	+ Interacts with the file system so difficult to test unfortunately
	+ Fix unassigned variable
	+ Make this extractable
	+ Extract GenerateModList
	+ Unfortunately interacts with AssemblyLoader and the file system so not
	+ really testable
	+ Add MessageQueue
	+ Add QueueLogger and supporting classes
	+ Allows logging to a queue
	+ Don't keep track of non-root needs unsatisfied
	+ Isn't used anywhere
	+ Add FatalErrorHandler
	+ Allows us to display a message to the user and quit when an
	+ unrecoverable error occurs.
	+ Can't really be tested unfortunately.
	+ Add background task support
	+ Allows a background task to be run and monitored, including if it exits
	+ due to an exception
	+ Begin creating Progress namespace
	+ Finish creating Progress namespace
	+ Unnecessary directives
	+ Add needs test for and/or and capitalization
	+ Separate out progress counter
	+ Make it so that all the values can be incremented but not otherwise
	+ messed with.
	+ Allow a new progress tracker to be initialized that shares a counter
	+ with another but uses a different logger
	+ Ensure Counter behaves like an int
	+ More unnecessary using
	+ Add test for ! (not) in :NEEDS
	+ More unnecessary using directives
	+ Extract application of patches to its own thread
	+ Allows it to not be bound by logging which can be slow
	+ Test and fix PatchProgress.ProgressFraction
	+ Patches are now only counted after needs are checked, so this shouldn't
	+ consider needs unsatisfied nodes
	+ Tweak
	+ Only convert to array once per pass
	+ This is expensive
	+ Make node matching its own method
	+ Saves a level of indentation
	+ Loop only applies to edit patches
	+ Saves another indentation level.  Also remove MM_PATCH_LOOP {} after
	+ done
	+ Don't convert to an array at all
	+ It's not necessary.  Also don't use switch - makes things cleaner.  It's
	+ only 3 cases anyway
	+ Ensure that user gets updates during long passes
	+ The patcher can potentially generate log messages faster than the main
	+ thread can log them, causing frames that are noticeably long with no
	+ updates.  This ensures that yields still happen then.
	+ Verified that this does not meaningfully affect performance.  Previous
	+ tests suggest that the time wasted by waiting until the next frame is
	+ relatively small.
	+ Without switch, i is valid here
	+ Ensure time between each check of the log queue
	+ This prevents the queue from being locked too often, slowing down the
	+ patching thread
	+ Convert to an array initially
	+ Apparently it saves a bit of time, and this won't be changed while
	+ patches run
	+ Having an actual array here no longer necessary
	+ Apparently Linq slows things down
	+ I guess it matters at scale
	+ Improve access of name a bit
	+ Looks like GetValue("name") has a bit of overhead, instead we can check
	+ if the UrlConfig's type == name
	+ Move loop out of loop
	+ This is all a bit loopy
	+ case should match filename
	+ matters on some filesystems
* 2017-0629: 2.8.1 (Sarbian) for KSP 1.3
	+ Improve some cat related code and add -ncats cmd line option
	+ Improve logging related to some exceptions
	+ Update project file
* 2017-0526: 2.8.0 (Sarbian) for KSP 1.3
	+ Revert "Temp revert of 1.3 changes to release a 1.2 patch"
	+ This reverts commit 29df624348391373485a82fec75e273ceed30648.
* 2017-0506: 2.7.6 (sarbian) for KSP 1.3
	+ KSP 1.3 changes (#66)
		- Add names to dialog windows
		- Now required
			- Adjust MMPatchLoaderIndex
		- A new LoadingSystem was added at the beginning (FontLoader).  This
	+ change ensures that MM will always be after the GameDatabase regardless.
			- Fix position of MM info in loading screen
		- Things seem to have moved
			- Remove unused field
			- Press Alt+F11 again to dismiss the menu
		- Apparently this wasn't a feature before (at least not recently) but
	+ pretty simple to implement
	+ Reload PartUpgrade System after patching (#70)
	+ As the part-upgrade data is initially populated prior to ModuleManager
	+ patching, this fix allows for the patches that are applied to the
	+ PARTUPGRADE nodes to be reloaded for use by the PartUpgrade system.
	+ With this fix in place the tech-nodes, names, descriptions, etc, for the
	+ part-upgrade parts located on the tech tree will use the proper
	+ post-patching config data.
		- This solution has been tested to work properly when used directly from
	+ a ModuleManagerPostLoad callback.
		- Fix for problems discovered in KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/#1628
	+ Temp revert of 1.3 changes to release a 1.2 patch

* 2014-0504: 2.0.9 (Swamp-Ig) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ So I've done my own enhancements to module manager.
	+ They seem to work pretty nice!  I'd really appreciate ppl testing it out on their various MM files prior to me pushing it back to the MM repo.
	+ Any issues you have - take them up with me not with sarbian
	+ Features:
	+ Order Preserving
		- now preserves the original order, both for nodes and for values.
	+ Use of NEEDS
```
PART:NEEDS[RealFuels] {
    name = dummyPartIgnore
    module = Part
    DOG {
        name = First
        key1:NEEDS[ProceduralParts|StretchySRB] = Original Value
        key2:NEEDS[!RealFuels] = Some other value
    }
}
```
	+ In the above, the part will only be defined if you have RealFuels loaded. You can do this on keys, values, patches, anywhere.
	+ key1 will be defined if (ProceduralParts OR StretchySRB are loaded) and RealFuels is NOT loaded.  You can still use , and it is treated like &. Not has highest precedence, then or, then and.
	+ Define an insertion point for any nodes or values
```
@PART[dummyPartIgnore]
{
    DOG {
        name = AddLast
        string = Will insert at the end
    }
    DOG,0 {
        name = AddFirst
        string = Will insert at the beginning
    }
    @DOG,0 { // Edits node zero as before, but ends up editing the above node
        string,0 = Insert before the string already at the beginning
    }          
}
```
	+ The index after the comma is where it will be inserted, this is relative to other nodes or values with the same name.
	+ Regexp replaces
```
@PART[dummyPartIgnore]
{
    @DOG[First] 
    {
        @string ^= :^.*$:First dog edit $& in place
    }
}
```
	+ Breaking this down, the first character defines the separator, the section between the first : and the second : is the match string, and the section following the second : is the replacement.
	+ For details on how to use regexp [see the documentation here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)
